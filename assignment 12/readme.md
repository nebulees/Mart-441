I ended up really sick last week, and I still kinda am sick, but I know I can't push anything out any further. So I thought I'd also attatch something I made about a month ago? At least my videos work, not sure why my mp3's are bogus. 

Anyway, I hope you're having a good day wherever you are. I definately am struggling still a little bit, but I will be honest I'm just trying to make it through the week right now. I hope it's understandable.
