                <h3> Hello! Thank you for the time to look at my site. I go by Rae, and I've worked on web projects like this on and off for the past six months. I'm learning quite a bit and I'm still very inexperienced, but I'm slowly starting to get the hang of it. I tend to take a lot of my inspiration from animation and art like it. I major in Media Arts, and I expect to graduate next year.  </h3>

                    <h1>Pressing Issue</h1>
                    <h3>I genuinely think the most pressing issue to date is the rising cost of living, and the lack of rising wages. Some rent today is more than what some people pay on a mortgage, and it's so difficult to keep afloat sometimes. I'm trying to combat it by trying to do a rent to own situation, so that way I can finally make a better life for myself and my family. </h3>
