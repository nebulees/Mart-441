Honestly, My biggest challenge was trying to figureo ut javascript, as I never did creative coding, so going through everything just feels like i'm about to just bust my head open with all these new concepts. 


I will be honest I did have a minor panic attack tackling this on top of everything else, but I did finally get it done. It really was much easier looking at everything and how it worked. Though I still hardly can wrap my hand around it. For me, it's just mostly me trying not to freak out about assignments, and just getting them done. 

Couldn't figure out why my other no wasn't working, but it kinda ended up being a funny ending. Though I did eventually figure out that I shouldn't reuse these endings, as it started messing up the code.
