I ended up really sick last week, and I still kinda am sick, but I know I can't push anything out any further. So I thought I'd also attatch something I made about a month ago? At least my videos work, not sure why my mp3's are bogus. 

Anyway, I hope you're having a good day wherever you are. I definately am struggling still a little bit, but I will be honest I'm just trying to make it through the week right now. I hope it's understandable. 

WHEN UPLOADING THE VIDEO TO GITHUB I GUESS IT WAS TOO BIG, AND ITS ALMOST TIME TO SUBMIT THIS SO I HAD TO THROW IN THE IFRAME INSTEAD OF WHAT I DID, IT WORKED EARLIER, BUT GITHUB IS BEING A BUTT. SO.... THIS HAS TO BE THE WAY.
