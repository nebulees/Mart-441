I really love nasa... And space. 

I couldn't really get the quereys to pull, but I think the data that I set up is really interesting, and I still have to submit something before 2 am My time so. 

Do you ever think about how there were at least ten people in this data set, whether seperately or not living in space? It's something to think about for the future, and how coding can make that a reality someday.
