                <h3> Hello! Thank you for the time to look at my site. I go by Rae, and I've worked on web projects like this on and off for the past six months. I'm learning quite a bit and I'm still very inexperienced, but I'm slowly starting to get the hang of it. I tend to take a lot of my inspiration from animation and art like it. I major in Media Arts, and I expect to graduate next year.  </h3>

I thought it would be interesteing to revisit the first assignment again and just well, do it again.  </h3>
