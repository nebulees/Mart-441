There was a bit more to learn here, and I switched things around, I got most of this working, but I found an error that i couldn't quite fix, the final tally would just not pull, no matter what I edited or fixed. I looked at it over and over, and I couldn't find the issue at all. 


I get a lot more on what I need, and i'm 99% sure the final was not pulling because I didn't add the actual code to be pulled, but its getting late, and I'm ready to sleep.
