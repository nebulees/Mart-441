Artists I enjoy: 
I don't have any favorite artists that affect the culture, but here's links to artists that are close to me, sister, my wife, and a friend in that order. 
- Wendy Red Star - She's spent her career upending stoic portrayals of Native Americans in photographs, sculptures, videos, fiber arts, and performances.
- Carla Jay Harris - Carla Jay Harris is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice includes photography, installation, collage, drawing, and digital image making. Her work documents intellectual, emotional and psychological environments.
- Lizzo, a musical artist that advocates for body positivity, and just happens to also make amazing songs.
