I know the assignment is late, but i'm hoping it's still good enoguh for something... 

I could not get the code for the 5th choice to work, no matter what I did. I am thankful that everything else worked how I wanted, but I'm sure there's a button or a key i didn't press that totally broke the code that I set up. When trying to get the return button in there, it completely broke everything, so right now. I'm just mostly exauhsted trying to fuss with this. 


I'll do better without the looming move and everything else hanging over my head. I know that for sure. It's not an excuse for work, and the work I submitted, but I hope it's at least known about what's going on.
