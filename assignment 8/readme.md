Man, I'm so exhaused, I know my code looks like i'm trying to get these done last minute, and that's true. I haven't gotten a break from work and I feel like ever since we started getting into things with java I can barely comprehend anything. I was able to grasp a bit more on what we were trying to do this week, but couldn't get the things to change thew way I wanted, but It does look like this.


This is a forcible reminder to just sit down with you and try to figure things out before things get too far. Thanks though.
