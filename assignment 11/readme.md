This one was pretty straight forward, It was fun to make 


I did break the code a little bit by making it bigger, but it was very fun to see and kinda makes it an art project on the side, I suggest taking the little block straight into the right hand corner. I, for the life of me could not get the mp3 to work, even though its set up in a way that it SHOULD play. Maybe it'll work on yours, I'm not sure. Either way, I have it, this is the assignment, and I will now turn this in.
